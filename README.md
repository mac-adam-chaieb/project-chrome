## Setup

To execute the scripts in the `scripts` directory, namely the `main.js` script, you need to have node.js installed on your local machine. Further information on installing node.js can [be found here](https://nodejs.org/download/).

After cloning the repo to a local directory, simply run:

```
node main.js
```

The script will generate all the metrics required in the specification in JSON format in the `metrics` directory.
