## Setup

To execute the scripts in the `scripts` directory, namely the `main.js` script, you need to have node.js installed on your local machine. Further information on installing node.js can [be found here](https://nodejs.org/download/).

After cloning the repo to a local directory, simply run:

```
node scripts/main.js [source-directory]
```

The script will generate all the metrics of source code in `source-directory` required in the specification in JSON format in the `metrics` directory.

## Getting the code

To get the code from the Chromium project, [look here](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code).
